# Sequence Prediction

The notebook Neural_Networks_function_prediction_.ipynb represents 2 examples of a sequence prediction:

1) The first pattern uses increasingly complex LSTM mechanisms to predict the function cos(x)+2cos(2x)+3cos(3x)+4cos(4x)+5cos(5x)+6cos(6x)+7cos(7x)+8cos(8x)+9cos(9x)+10cos(10x).

2) The second pattern tries to predict the next 12 points based in the series [10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90] using an LSTM mechanism.

The notebook SARIMAX.ipynb depicts the use of a SARIMAX model. This notebook is still under construction
